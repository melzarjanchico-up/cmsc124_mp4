# CMSC124 MP4: Expressions
**Name**: Melzar Jan E. Chico  
**Year & Section**: BS ComSci III - CMSC110B  
**Date**: 18 December 2021

### ☑️ Instructions

1. Create a program that will accept an expression in infix notation and is capable of converting it to prefix as well as postfix notation. Similarly, you should also be able to accept an expression in prefix notation and convert it to infix and postfix notation; and accept an expression in postfix notation, and convert it to infix and prefix notation. Assume likewise that an expression can be erroneous, thus provide appropriate error-handling schemes.
2. Use the same algorithms you have implemented in #1 to accept an expression (this time variables are actual numbers) and evaluate them to give the final answer. For clarity purposes, separate each token with a space. Also, assume that user may input erroneous expressions, so include exception handling in your implementation

### ☑️ Scope of Work
I written all of the code from my machine problem, with some of the source code adopted/inspired from the
Internet. Here they are to be specific:

#### for chico_mp4_1.py

#### for chico_mp4_2.py
